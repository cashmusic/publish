### What kind of impact does music have in our world?

Music speaks far beyond words. It is a capsule for the human condition. Without music, we would never understand the true depth of our emotional ability; and further, weâ€™d have one less way to transfer these intangibles to others.

### How do we ensure that artists' voices are heard?

Exposure. We are sinking deep into a culture where we are at risk of losing important voices to the deafening throes of information overload. The more solidarity between artists and and their allies will help create a collective shout, and hopefully together we can cut through the noise.
