### Who are you, and what do you do?

I am Astra Elane, the founder and frontwoman of Seattle band [The Gods Themselves](https://www.wearethegodsthemselves.com/). I sing and play guitar and more recently am producing and mixing the band’s tracks ([new EP Glamour & Grime](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/glamour-grime-ep/1392677552) release: 06/15/18). I am at my most content when challenged to translate what I hear in my head into actual media. Creating noise, invoking emotions and connecting with people through song is my bag, baby!

###What hardware do you use?

 I’ve got a couple [MusicMan](https://www.music-man.com/instruments/guitars) guitars that I love, but last Fall I decided I wanted a smaller scale guitar and asked a friend to build me a custom 7/8 size [Warmouth](http://www.warmoth.com/). It’s perfect, high shine black and chrome with floating bridge and inlaid star frets. I call him Pablo, he’s sassy.

 My favorite pedal is my [Strymon Timeline](https://www.strymon.net/products/timeline/). It’s the most amazing digital delay machine ever built. By far the most expensive thing on my board, but so diverse and optimized when run in stereo.

 For live sound I run a stereo set up. Behind me, stage right I play through a [Vox AC-30](http://www.voxamps.com/ac30c2) and to really capture my stereo effects, I also run an [AC-15](http://www.voxamps.com/ac15c1) stage left.

###And what software?

 I use [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/en/) for writing, recording and even mixing. I could never afford ProTools so this is the software I learned, and I dig it!

###What would be your dream setup?

I’m pretty happy with my rig. One thing I do dream about is expanding our home studio to include a live room big enough where I could track drums and keep a selection of amps and funky organs and strange, cool instruments that would be fun to experiment with for recording sessions.
