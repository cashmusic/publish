### Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm [Mozart's Sister](https://mozartssister.bandcamp.com/) and I write and produce pop music!

###What hardware do you use?

I have a few synths - a [Juno 106](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/juno106.php), [Nord Lead 2](http://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-lead-2x), [Elektron Monomachine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektron_Monomachine), and a [Roland V-Synth](https://www.roland.com/global/products/v-synth/) (really hilarious a cool 90's synth). Those make up the bulk of my hardware sounds!

###And what software?

[Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/), [Massive](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive/), [Waves Pack](http://www.waves.com/bundles/power-pack), [Kontakt](https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-5/), and [Fab Filters](http://www.fabfilter.com/). 

###What would be your dream setup?

A really nice studio with a big window by the ocean with a [big plate reverb](http://tapeop.com/interviews/btg/28/build-plate-reverb/) and lots of synths and [Eventide](https://www.eventideaudio.com/) effects units. I'd like a [Prophet Synth](http://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/dave-smith-instruments-prophet-12) and I want to learn [Max MSP](http://www.instructables.com/id/Intro-to-MaxMSP/) and it would be awesome to have a [Buchla Music Easel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JI0LzjvjjI) just to have around for inspiration. Also, [Genelec monitors](https://www.genelec.com/). But I'm actually pretty happy with what I have now :)
