### Who are you, and what do you do?

I play bass and sing in [Deerhoof](http://deerhoof.net/). I am originally from Tokyo, Japan. I live in Brooklyn, NY. I am a dog lover.

###What hardware do you use?

I recently ordered a custom bass from [Serek Basses](http://www.serekbasses.com/). [Jake](http://www.serekbasses.com/about) from Serek built a beautiful short scale maple bass for me. It's almost as light as my old [Hofner](http://www.gettyimages.com/event/all-tomorrows-parties-day-3-94263701#satomi-matsuzaki-of-deerhoof-performs-on-stage-at-all-tomorrows-at-picture-id94502009). I like jumping around on stage so I have been using Hofner for almost twenty years but when Jake brought me his hand crafted bass at sound check on tour, I totally fell in love! It sounds like a king. It makes a beautiful deep round tone like Rickenbacker yet it's light as feather.

I use a [Genz Benz Shuttle Max](http://www.genzbenz.com/?fa=detail&mid=2262&sid=610&cid=95) amp which has both tube and solid state preamps built in. It's great because I can blend them! It's like having rice and bread at the same time.

My pedals are a [Boss tuner](https://www.boss.info/us/categories/tuners_metronomes/), an [Electro Harmonix Octave Multiplexer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSC2edXk9YY) for kicking dance vibe,  [Crowther Hotcake Overdrive](http://www.crowtheraudio.net/products/hotcake/) for creating some buzz, and a [Dunlop Fullbore Metal Overdrive](http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/m116-fullbore-metal) for head banging.

###And what software?
I don't use software. Less gears = less trouble is my motto.

###What would be your dream setup?

If I could just sing both the bass part and vocal part at the same time, that would be great. I would bring one microphone on tour! I love easy set up. I get worried with checking my bass and gears at the airport. Materials break. Going on tour is a risk managing test. How can I play like myself without THINGS?
