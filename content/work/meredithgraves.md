###

By the time the clock strikes eight AM, I’m out of bed, overcaffeinated, medicated, and briefed: I’ve got three or four written pieces due in the next 48 hours, two of which I haven’t started, one of which involves hours of meticulous baking in addition to writing, plus a photoshoot, a research and development meeting, two phone calls, no groceries in the house, a friend with a crisis, the knowledge that I’m hosting a dinner for fifteen people in three days, artists emailing with questions about cover art for their upcoming LPs, plans for a work day with two other freelancer friends, commitments I made a month ago that I’m absolutely unable to attend, save for the fact that I have to.

This is an example of a bad day, or at least a difficult one. There are, minimum, two of these a week, unless I put an unbelievable amount of time into holding my shit together-- which feels like spinning plates while playing Jenga and getting a Brazillian wax at the same time. 

In addition to being a member of a touring band, a full-time freelance culture writer and columnist, owner-operator of a small record label (a subsidiary of a big, real one), and now a food writer and baker, I am sometimes a DJ, a moderator or speaker on panels as well as at colleges, a model, a record-shop employee, a radio and television personality, event coordinator, the list goes on and on. 

A day in my life starts with a business call about hosting a charity event and punk show. I respond to emails from editors who have thankfully considered and accepted my pitches and schedule out which days I can work on each piece before they’re all due, then quickly move on to menu planning for a dinner party. I spend my three “free hours” writing before I leave for a two-hour meeting, after which point I go home and spend two hours transcribing an hour of interview tape before outlining a story due three days from now, confirming all my appointments for the next day, and going to bed by midnight.

The day I just described? Today. A completely average, rainy day. Honestly, a pretty good day-- it’s 2 PM, I haven’t had to put makeup on or leave the house yet, and I’m drinking my fifth cup of coffee at my kitchen table, in my peaceful house I share with my boyfriend and our roommate (all three of us, coincidentally, are freelance). I go to sleep at night knowing I get paid to write about cake and feminism, and occasionally, I get paid to fly to Australia and scream. 

But when people ask what I do, I just tell them I’m in a band, because it’s easier than explaining all of the above. If I do make the effort to explain the intricacies of my survival to people, even if they seem genuinely curious, it will inevitably end with them fighting not to roll their eyes. How hard it must be, they think, having your makeup done, DJing small nights at quiet bars, getting fan letters. 

And that’s a reasonable assessment, and I’d never condemn anyone for rolling their eyes at a position no one could understand unless they lived it too. My job is the best, and the worst, in the world. I wish only to dispel some of the more common ideas people seem to have about what I do:

Pitchfork and Rolling Stone liking your band does not mean your band is lucrative, at all. Musicians do not get paid to do interviews or photoshoots, and press does not mean you’re getting paid. The cost of ‘recoup’-- that is, selling enough records to cover the cost of making the record in the first place-- is insane. Our band’s only record came out in April of 2014. I have not seen royalties, nor have I seen money from streaming. 

This, by the way, is totally normal. Remember also that most listeners access nearly 100% of the music they listen to for free, and when people are expected to pay for music, it becomes a Tidal wave of anger and contempt. I understand this as both a musician and listener. 

The only money our band makes comes from touring: playing shows and selling our records. We would split what’s left five ways after paying for our rental van (we never had enough money at once to put a downpayment on a van of our own), gas, housing, feeding ourselves every day, replacing broken equipment, flights if we’re going overseas, tour managers in countries where we can’t speak the language or legally drive, a backline. It’s exciting to be paid at all for making music, so even if you make $300-400 off a four-week tour, you still feel like you succeeded. That’s a couple months of groceries if you play your cards right and shop frugally. 

Being in a full-time touring band makes it almost impossible to hold down a job during the times you are home. That’s why so many touring musicians resort to low-paying restaurant or retail work, getting hired and fired willy-nilly between tours. No job that provides benefits or tenure would hire someone who intends to be gone six months out of the year, and if you use the pump-and-dump method of getting jobs, eventually there will be so many gaps in your resume and unusable references that the act of getting temporary jobs will become nearly impossible.

So you decide to take matters into your own hands and freelance (a choice that’s already difficult for me, seeing as I’m a lazy employee and a neurotic boss). Freelancing is ostensibly more difficult when you’re on the road. You’re an exhausted, usually sick zombie from playing shows every night for 4 weeks. Your time in hotels (if you can afford hotels) or anywhere with consistent wifi to do necessary research is limited to the second you check in at night (usually 3 AM allowing for load out and the 45 minute drive outside of whatever city you played in, because hotels are always cheaper near the airport) to your 9 AM van call, because you’ve got to do another 9 hour drive to the next city. Work is the last thing you want to do. If you manage to get anything done, the quality suffers because you’re exhausted, distracted, and 80% of your energy is focused on the needs of the other five people in the van with you.

So I’ll be straight with you, I have a budget of about $1,000/month in rent, plus whatever for other bills (including massive, crippling amounts of student loan debt), groceries, utilities, public transportation. That is a lot of work when you realize it comes from a combination of freelance pieces that pay $50-300, savings, gigs that pay $0-200 a pop.

Before you say, ‘Well, you choose to live in New York City and it’s very expensive there,’ just note that I didn’t have a career to speak of before moving here. In my previous lives, I have been a bartender, a retail employee, and a seamstress. I have no qualifications to hold down a real job, and I have never made more than 11k a year. I am not ashamed of this. You are batshit insane if you think I would trade DJing, lecturing at colleges, and writing for the New York Times to go back to a life of working 40-60 hours a week (and more often than not, working two jobs at once) so someone else who yells at me every day can not only profit but own multiple businesses and properties.

I am consensually working these long-ass, impossible hours to be paid in less money, but more freedom. 

No, it doesn’t always feel amazing to put three days of work into a written piece for which I’ll make $50, but it feels exponentially better than having to clean up after vomiting 22-year-olds who sit at my bar spewing racist jokes to each other. 

It feels much better when a sixteen year old girl emails me and tells me reading what I had to say made her feel so much better, or that listening to my record helps her with trouble at home or in school.

It feels great to make my own schedule, to overcommit to projects that excite me and make me feel like I’m part of something, to book shows and bring my friends’ bands to town, to help people put their records out. It feels great to control the whole operation from the means of production up. 

It feels amazing to file a piece for Elle magazine sitting in a rooftop hammock in Montreal. It feels amazing to interview Erase Errata over Skype wearing pajamas on my couch. It feels amazing to have my work quoted in international newspapers and taught on syllabi at NYU (a school that rejected me at 17), to see my photograph in the Guardian, to see my lyrics tattooed on kids’ arms, to be called a thought leader, to interview people I’ve admired for most of my life, to tour with people I never dreamed I’d meet, and most of all, to be respected for the career I’ve chosen-- the career of being myself.

Yeah, I’ve been known to tear up in the grocery store. I am overwhelmed by the cost of food, which should be a right, not a privilege. I resist the urge to break it down to words-per-head-of-lettuce. I smile at the kids who work the checkout and chat them up, knowing how frustrating it is to work long hours in retail. I smile internally about the fact that per hour, they definitely make more money than I do. I get home, I stock my shelves and my fridge, and I exhale, because I bought those groceries with money I earned writing about feminism, about art, about social justice. 

I earned that money the night I got bottled on stage in Switzerland, I earn that money introducing writer friends to editor friends to assure people with our kind of politics can be printed in places where we’ll have readers and influence. My friends get me paid, and I get my friends paid. We have all consented to this, and we work every day to make it better for ourselves and each other, and for the next generation of artists and writers.

Yes, I am fucking tired from doggy-paddling the length and depth of these long, complicated days. But I swim, because I would rather persist than drown, and because I know that since I am my own life raft, once in awhile, when the rapids abate, I can kick up my heels and float.
