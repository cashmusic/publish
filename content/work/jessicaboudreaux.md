## Who are you, and what do you do?

I'm Jessica Boudreaux. I'm a Portland, OR based musician (among other things), originally from Louisiana. I've been in Portland for the last 8 years, first pursuing a career in film and then in the last 4 years focusing mainly on my band [Summer Cannibals](http://www.summercannibals.com/) that I sing, play guitar and write for. [Kill Rock Stars](http://www.killrockstars.com) just released our third full length and before that I self-released our first two albums through my own record label [New Moss Records](http://newmossrecords.bigcartel.com/). Early this year I started playing and touring with one of my favorite bands [The Thermals](http://www.thethermals.com/) as their new guitarist, which still feels like a very weird, amazing and dreamy dream.

##What hardware do you use?

**Amp situation:** I use a new [Fender Twin Reverb](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/guitar-amplifiers/vintage-pro-tube/65-twin-reverb/0217300000.html), as much as I love using vintage gear I just don't have the patience for it when we're on tour. The new amps are way more reliable and honestly I don't hear THAT much of a difference. When we're just playing in town I do really love to play my [Fender Quad Reverb](https://reverb.com/item/1637952-1971-fender-quad-reverb-guitar-amplifier) from the 70's. Sounds so huge and rad and is also a massive pain in the ass to move. **Guitar situation:** I play a [Fender Mustang 65' reissue](https://reverb.com/item/2901300-fender-mg65-65-reissue-mustang-mij-olympic-white), it's short scale and makes my life as a small person a little bit easier in terms of playing. **Current pedal situation:** [Homebrew UFO Fuzz Pedal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx5HA50skXs) *(I never turn this off!)*, [Death By Audio Fuzz War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESevU8aD6bM) *(for when I'm soloing)*, [Malekko EKKO 616 MKII](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuRKh237Nbo) and a [Boss Digital Reverb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk1lJgZG87c).

##And what software?
I use [Logic Pro X](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) for making demos. I love it so much. I use the built in "drummers" with shit tons of distortion on them, plug my guitar/bass/vocals mics direct into a [Presonus Firebox](https://www.presonus.com/products/FireBox) and use the built in amp simulators and compressors in Logic to make them sound cool. I've got a more elaborate recording set up for when I want to record live drums and live amps in my studio. When I do video stuff I'm one of very few people who ended up kind of liking [Final Cut Pro X](http://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/), a lot of people ragged on it for a while (maybe not anymore? I've been outta the game for a few years) but I liked it for the same reason I love Logic Pro...it's intuitive and user friendly. Other software: does [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) count? I've been embarrassingly into that lately ([@SCannibalsBand](https://twitter.com/SCannibalsBand) ;)

##What would be your dream setup?

Honestly, I've got everything that I need to make the art I want to make right now. There's always pedals and guitars and random pieces of gear that I'd like to buy but I don't feel limited at all in any capacity when it comes to creating with the set up I have right now.
