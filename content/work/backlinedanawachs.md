### Who are you, and what do you do?

Dana Wachs, aka [Vorhees](http://www.vorheesmusic.com/). I am a composer, audio engineer, and producer.

###What hardware do you use?

One piece of gear that I use whether I am performing, composing, or doing live sound is my pair of [Eventide H9 pedals](https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/stompboxes/multi-effect-processor/h9), (as my [H3000](https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/rackmount/ultra-harmonizer/h3000-series) is in line for repair). Exploring the thousands of options that each algorithm offers is a sonic adventure. I'm a massive fan of their nuanced reverbs and pitch factor effects, plus the continued release of new algorithms, upgradeable through bluetooth. I'm an Eventide lifer.

###And what software?
When recording and doing live sound, I track to [Logic](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) or [Pro Tools](http://www.avid.com/pro-tools), and use [Waves](http://www.waves.com/plugins) plugins when needed, but mostly try to get all I need from the source sound. I do not use a computer when I perform live.

###What would be your dream setup?

A soundproofed home studio, filled out with all that I currently own, plus a couple mono and poly voiced synths from [Moog](https://www.moogmusic.com/) and [Dave Smith](https://www.davesmithinstruments.com/), a couple Roland Echo's ([Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_RE-201) and [Chorus](http://musicfrombigego.com/roland-chorus-echo-sre-555/)), a [Fairchild 670](http://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins/compressors-limiters/fairchild-tube-limiter-collection.html), small selection of ribbon and large diaphragm condensor microphones, [a vintage Fender Princeton reverb](http://www.vintageguitar.com/8931/the-fender-princeton/), [a 16 channel Neve console](http://vintageking.com/rupert-neve-designs-5088-16-channel-16x-5032), and a [vibraslap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTQWvSreQG4).
