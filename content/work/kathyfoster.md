##What hardware do you use?

The first thing I think of when I hear "hardware" is cymbal stands. Most of mine are used and brand-less. I love my drumset though. It's a ['69 Ludwig mahogany](http://www.ludwig-drums.com/en-us/ludwig/products/drumkits) kit. My favorite sticks are [ProMark's Neil Peart signatures](http://www.neilpeartdrumsticks.com/). No, I'm not a [Rush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLBLk4ibAk) fan. They're slightly slimmer than average but made of white oak so they have a good weight to them.  For bass, I play a standard [Fender Jazz bass](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-basses/jazz-bass/) through an [Ampeg SVT Classic](http://www.ampeg.com/products/classic/svtcl/) with [4x10 Ampeg cabinet](http://www.ampeg.com/products/classic/svt410hlf/). I love my set-up and haven't changed it for years. The 4x10 cabinet is the perfect size and plenty loud. I have my [Ibanez Tube Screamer](http://www.ibanez.com/products/u_effect_series16.php?year=2016&cat_id=6&series_id=153) pedal on at all times which gives me the perfect tone. I use a [Boss Super Overdrive](https://www.boss.info/us/products/sd-1/) pedal for feedback and noise, and sometimes the [Boss Digital Delay](https://www.boss.info/us/products/dd-3/) for added noise effects. I recently got a [Boss Loop Station](https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-1/) pedal to make pre-recorded loops of noise. I love noise! I also have a 70's [Gibson SG guitar](http://www.gibson.com/Products/Electric-Guitars/SG.aspx), a [Fender Telecaster](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/telecaster/) guitar, a [Fender acoustic guitar](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/acoustic-guitars/), [Ampeg Gemini combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miLPCXI65KU) guitar amp, [Fender Blues Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQETPDgsucw) combo amp, [Alamo combo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH0fkNfQrE0) amp, and a few other effects pedals. Oh, and I recently got a new Mac Desktop computer to replace my planned obsolete 2007 MacBook, mainly because I want to start recording music digitally.

##And what software?
I haven't used much software lately, except [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html). I used to work with [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) a lot. I just bought [Logic](http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) recording software though. I've always been into analog machines and have done a lot of home recording that way for years. I have a couple [Tascam cassette 4-tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsa-H4t4PQA) and a [1/2" Teac 8-track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aEgR_vkMjw) reel-to-reel. I like the tactile experience of them, and their warm sound. I like how cool fuck-ups can sound. The Thermals and Hurry Up have recorded almost everything to tape. But I'm finally ready to experiment with a digital set-up to save money and time, and to make some higher fidelity recordings. I do love lo-fi and trashy recordings the most though.

##What would be your dream setup?

My dream set-up is not so much about specific gear or equipment, though I love 60's-70's vintage shit. My dream is to have the perfect, cozy space where everything is set up and ready to use all the time - guitar, bass, drums, pedals, mics, recording gear, etc. I'm working towards that now. I've had it in the past and it makes a world of difference to be able to act upon inspiration when it hits. It's been a long time since I've been able to set up a space like that. I'm looking forward to getting to that place again.
