### What kind of impact does music have in our world?

I feel like this is an answer where one can only speak from personal experience. Music has been the backbone of my existence since the womb.

My parents would play music to me before I was even present in the world; my mother, a DJ. My Father, a guitarist. Both music obsessives. We would never have a car journey that was silent and never have a holiday that went un-sound-tracked. My Dad placed a guitar in my hands at age 5 and I’ve never looked back. I was hooked; it became part of my being.

Music is the most constant and best friend I’ve ever had. It never asks for anything and gives so much. It can give context and clarity to a situation you are unable to process. It can scaffold, yet in turn is able to be completely fertile. It can be a teacher yet it can also just exist. It is the essence, the conduit and the amplifier.

### What can we do to ensure that artists' voices are heard?

I feel like so much has been done to promote musicians being autonomous and we have made giant steps. However, there is a long way to go.

>For musicians to be truly heard we need to be empowered with tools to build our own framework. Existing foundations need to become malleable.

A lot of artists feel allotted only a certain amount of autonomy and that there are still certain aspects of their careers that ‘don’t concern them’. There needs to be a reciprocal and transparent relationship of trust, and a shared lust for joy.
