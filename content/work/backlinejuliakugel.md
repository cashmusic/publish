###What hardware do you use?

I play a [Fender Mustang](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/mustang/) out of a [Vox AC15 amp](http://www.musiciansfriend.com/vox-ac15) with a tuner pedal and an [EP Booster](https://xotic.us/effects/ep-booster). I just fell in love with an Earthquaker pedal called [the Transmisser](https://www.earthquakerdevices.com/transmisser/) that I looking forward to using in the future!

###And what software?

To demo, I use my iPhone or [Cool Edit Pro](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Audio-Editors-Recorders/Cool-Edit-Pro.shtml) on my PC that is a very very old and slow program but its the only one I know how to use.


###What would be your dream setup?

I’m happy with my set up. However, I'd like to own a [Music Man](https://www.music-man.com/amps) amp and a [Rickerbacker](http://www.rickenbacker.com/) guitar just to switch things up. Plus for my personal use, I would love a piano, a steel drum, and an accordion.
