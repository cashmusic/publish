### Who are you, and what do you do?

My name is [Jamie Aaron Aux](http://jamieaaronaux.com/). I'm a multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer. I write and record music out of a home studio in Seattle that I designed and built myself. I also enjoy customizing and building guitar-related things. My most recent project was a 2x12 guitar cabinet with [Celestial Vintage 30s](http://celestion.com/product/1/vintage_30/) that I made for myself to go with my [Orange AD30](https://orangeamps.com/products/guitar-amp-heads/ad-series/ad30htc-head/).

###What hardware do you use?

I run a pretty lean set-up since I am generally tracking alone. For *[Close the Circle](http://jamieaaronaux.com/music)* I used a [Roland Studio Capture interface](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UA1610) with a pair of [Summit Audio 2BA-221](http://www.summitaudio.com/2ba221.html) tube mic pres in front. I did a good amount of research to find a good vocal mic for myself (female, generally a quiet singer) and am in love with the [Peluso 22 251 vacuum tube mic](http://www.pelusomicrophonelab.com/microphones/22251.html) I scored from [Reverb.com](https://reverb.com/). [Chris Common](https://chriscommon.wordpress.com/) tracked drums on three of the songs, and mixed the entire album. He works out of an incredible private studio in El Paso, but I've taken an oath of secrecy about the gear contained within.

###And what software?
I use [Pro Tools](http://www.avid.com/pro-tools) and am a big fan of the [Slate Digital collection](http://slatedigital.com/virtual-console-collection/) and [Eventide reverb plug-ins](https://www.eventideaudio.com/products/plugins/reverb/ultrareverb).

###What would be your dream setup?

I'm about to leave behind my sweet and convenient home studio and move to New York City, so my current dream is to have any sort of reasonable space to continue recording once I move. Gear-wise, I like to keep my dreams attainable. Since tracking the album I've passed the Studio Capture on to a new owner and have my sights set on a [Universal Audio Apollo 8p](http://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-8p.html), as well as making a significant upgrade to my monitors (I'm still in the research phase there). But mostly the sound and the vibe of the room is, for me, paramount to the gear the sound goes through.
