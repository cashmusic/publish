##What hardware do you use?

Currently, at this very moment, I use...

([STV Ernie Ball electric guitar](http://www.music-man.com/instruments/guitars/st-vincent) (for bass, rhythm and lead) 
plugged into a ([Boss RC 300 Loop station](https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-300/) (the really big one) 
into a ([Malekko Heavy Industries Reverb](https://malekkoheavyindustry.com/product/spring/) (the little baby pocket sized one) which I highly recommend
into an ([Earthquaker Devices Organizer](http://earthquakerdevices.com/shop/organizer/) (makes your guitar sound like an organ) 
into a ([Boss tuner](https://www.boss.info/us/categories/tuners_metronomes/) (keeps your guitar sounding fresh) 
into a ([Fender Hot Rod Deluxe amp](http://shop.fender.com/en-US/guitar-amplifiers/vintage-pro-tube/hot-rod-deluxe-iii/product-2230200.html) (currently looking for something that can handle more power.

##And what software?
The software of my brain and slowly but surely ([Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/).

##What would be your dream setup?

I'm not sure or really care about the technical name for all of this but I'd love to have a situation where I can sync up my loop pedal to Ableton Live so I can play and control my own beats better. I also want a setup where I can easily switch from bass tones to lead tin like tones and feel completely entrenched in my guitarâ€”so maybe like 2-3 completely opposing amps to balance out the EQ. I'd really just like to figure out a setup where I can easily control the instruments I'm playing on my own. I dream of playing live with 10+ instruments on stage and a wall of half stacks.
