###What kind of impact does music have in our world?

It's our memory and our future, simultaneously. Music links us to long forgotten emotions and introduces us to new ways to feel. It's a strangely cohesive way to contain and express every version of yourself. And dancing - music gave us the Roger Rabbit.

###How do we ensure that voices will get heard?

It would help if we could hop off of this bullshit cultural merry-go-round where we assume someone else is taking care of the art and artists we love. It's okay to take small measures. It's okay to listen to the needs of the artists around us, and lend encouragement, support, and resources.
