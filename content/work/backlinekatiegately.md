### Who are you, and what do you do?

Hi, I'm Katie Gately and I make noises/music behind my computer.

###What hardware do you use?

I have an evil habit of ordering loads of equipment off of Amazon that I can't afford and using it for a few weeks then returning it for a refund and saying the return reason is *"Accidental Order"*

Sooo....my hardware shifts frequently :)

Right now I am obsessed with the [TC-Helicon VoiceLive 3](http://www.tc-helicon.com/en/products/voicelive-3/) and the [Korg Kaoss Pad (KP3+)](http://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/kaoss_pad_kp3_plus/) and an [Elektron Octatrack](https://www.elektron.se/products/octatrack/) for vocal processing and play. I use a MacBook Pro and a bunch of controllers too: [Akai MPK49](http://www.akaipro.com/product/mpk49) for keys, [Live's Push 2](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/), A [Behringer BCR2000](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/BCR2000/p/P0245) for more knobs to wiggle and also an amazing [Behringer X-Touch](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Computer-Audio/Desktop-Controllers/X-TOUCH/p/P0B1X).

I record with a [Rode NTK](http://www.rode.com/microphones/ntk) and sometimes a [SM58](http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone) and use a really cheap [Behringer Eurorack](http://www.music-group.com/Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Analog-Mixers/X1204USB/p/P0A0H) mixer with an [Apogee Duet](http://www.apogeedigital.com/products/duet) interface and Glyph drives for running set off of....Oh and of course monitors ([Yamaha HS80Ms](http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/speakers/hs_series/hs80m/)) and headphones ([Sony MDR-7506](https://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-MDR7506/)) I really like these because they have a very flat response. Nothing sounds impressive on them. So I'm constantly riddled with anxiety and self-doubt about how things sound and am never really happy with anything I do. In my head this approach makes sense!

###And what software?

[Ableton Live 9 Suite](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/feature-comparison/) (for music and SFX processing) and [Pro Tools 11](http://www.avid.com/pro-tools) (for film sound design) and loads of plug-ins. The [GRM Tools](http://www.inagrm.com/grmtools) are the most amazing and I'm always aggressively using [Melodyne](http://www.celemony.com/en/melodyne/what-is-melodyne) and [Izotope's RX](https://www.izotope.com/en/products/repair-and-edit/rx.html) and [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/).

###What would be your dream setup?

OMG is there time. Ok well realistically, I just want an [Apollo Twin](http://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-twin.html) because my Apogee Duet has massive dropout issues right now with USB and I need to upgrade to Thunderbolt. However, if I had unlimited money I would throw down on a fancier model like the [Apollo 16](http://www.uaudio.com/audio-interfaces/apollo-16-mkii.html).  I am constantly battling latency limitations so I also hope to eventually build a Hackintosh and try to get around the 4GB RAM limitations I currently face in Live.

I would also love a real keyboard and synth - probably the [Nord Stage Lead](http://www.nordkeyboards.com/products/nord-lead-a1) (and the [Nord Rack 2X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvKkaLmNuto)!) and/or a [Roland JD-XA](https://www.roland.com/global/products/jd-xa/sounds/). If I'm getting delusional, I would kill for a real piano. Any kind. And while super nerdy, I would love some electronic drums (i.e. [Roland V Drums](https://www.rolandcorp.com.au/categories/v-drums/).)

I can afford none of this but I will keep going.....because a girl can dream....

I'd love every single [UAD plug-in](http://www.uaudio.com/uad-plugins.html) as well as.....[Xfer Serum](https://xferrecords.com/products/serum), [Omnisphere](https://www.spectrasonics.net/products/omnisphere/), everything by [u-he](https://www.u-he.com/), [Brainworx](http://www.brainworx-music.de/), [Fabfilter](http://www.fabfilter.com/) and [Audio Damage](https://www.audiodamage.com/). You know how some people really are into collecting shoes? Plug-ins are my shoes! I will end up homeless soon if I don't keep my plug-in obsession in check because I can't return them on Amazon and I can't steal plug-ins. I can steal other stuff but not plug-ins (True Geniuses make them!)

Finally, let's throw in a [Neve Console](http://vintageking.com/consoles-mixers/consoles-by-brand/neve-consoles) for full-blown never-gonna-happen dreams ....and a of couple microphones like the [Soundman OKM II](http://www.soundman.de/products/okm-ii-studio/) and a [Sennheiser MKE](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/shot-gun-microphone-cameras-video-recordings-mke-400) shotgun for field recordings.
