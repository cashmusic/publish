### Who are you, and what do you do?

I’m Janet - drummer, backup singer, songwriting collaborator, setlist maker for lots of bands but mostly Sleater-Kinney and Quasi. 
###What hardware do you use?

Funny to ask a drummer about hardware because to us that is a literal question. My hardware is all made by [DW](http://www.dwdrums.com/) - I prefer the lighter stuff - not sure why drum hardware is so heavy and cumbersome! I keep thinking I’ll work with a bike designer to come up with a completely new approach but haven’t yet. It all needs to fit into a small soft case and I must be able to lift it into the car myself - that is my one rule. In regards to drums, the sound in my head is a [1967 Ludwig maple kit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/30559980@N07/sets/72157634828039753/) so that’s what I play give or take a few years. I’ve had almost all the finishes at one time or another, but currently own a faded green sparkle and black oyster tiger stripe. My only sponsorship is for my snare - [a 14 x 6.5” Craviotto maple drum](https://www.craviottodrums.com/snare-drums) (RIP Johnny Craviotto!) Heads are strictly [Remo](http://remo.com/products/drumheads/) - coated ambassadors on the snare and toms and Powerstroke 3 on the batter side of the kick. Evans sent me every head they make and I just couldn’t find the right mix of crack and body. But thanks Evans. Cymbals are [Zildjian A Custom](https://zildjian.com/a-family/a-custom) and I guess the crashes are on the big side (two 20”) because the dude salesman at Guitar Center once asked me why I wanted a ride cymbal as a crash. My ride is 22” (although I have loved an old 1960’s 24” that I played on Dig Me Out) and the hats are standard size Quick Beats. I know it’s nitpicky but I absolutely prefer a round throne - [those saddle kind](https://reverb-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--a07VMfh4--/a_exif,c_limit,e_unsharp_mask:80,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_south,h_620,q_90,w_620/v1414446745/kxsxhvy4mtlpjo7ebwbr.jpg) make me feel funny.

###And what software?

My basement writing rig is a goofy set of [Roland e-drums](https://www.roland.com/global/categories/drums_percussion/) that I run through a dock into my iPad Garageband. For demoing into the real computer I recently was gifted [Addictive Drum](https://www.xlnaudio.com/addictivedrums) software that makes the electronic pads sound pretty incredible. I choose from a number of Ludwig sounding kits recorded under much better conditions than what I’m accustomed to. For practice I play my iPod with headphones and also use the [Drummer’s Metronome](http://www.drummersmetronome.com/) app on my phone quite a bit. 

###What would be your dream setup?

I pretty much have my dream setup as far as playing goes. My kit is a monster. A real area of improvement however would be recording works in progress in my practice space. I’ve never quite figured out a simple and easy solution that doesn’t sound like a caveman beating the shit out of sheet metal.
