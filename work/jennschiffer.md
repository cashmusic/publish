### What kind of impact does music have in our world?

>Music is a friend who is great at listening even though it doesn't have ears and you have nothing to say at the moment. It has a way of telling us how horrible and wonderful life is at the same time and it magically makes that reality easy to digest.

### What can we do to ensure that artists' voices are heard?

>Imagine being blue without the blues. We, as consumers, need to be better at listening to the needs of artists and facilitate (to the best of our craft and abilities) or we will lose their music - our greatest friend.
